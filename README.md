## About  
This project is a **premium‑quality landing page** showcasing a luxury watch inspired by the Porsche brand aesthetic. The aim is to combine sleek design, fluid animations, and responsive layout — giving visitors a feeling of luxury and performance in digital form. Since this is one of my favourite projects, special care was taken on visual details, responsiveness, and user interaction.

## Features  
- Elegant hero section with full‑width background and watch‑highlight  
- Smooth scrolling navigation & animated transitions  
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet and mobile  
- Hover & interaction effects on key elements (buttons, images)  
- Clean and modular HTML, CSS and JavaScript codebase  
- Asset optimisation for fast load performance  

## Technologies  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (including Flexbox / Grid)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Optional: CSS animations & transitions  
- No heavy frameworks — lightweight, fast, and custom‑built

Future Enhancements
Add a dark mode toggle to enhance the luxury feel.

Introduce scroll‑triggered animations for more dynamic storytelling.

Integrate a product gallery / carousel to showcase multiple watch variants.

Performance optimisation: lazy‑load images, implement WebP format, reduce CSS/JS size.
